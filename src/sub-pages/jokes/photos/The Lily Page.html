      Hi. My names Lily.
      I have blonde hair, blue eyes,
      and VERY chewed fingernails.
      My favorite color is indigo, purple,
      and navy blue. Anyway, so, like, i started a blog because one day I was swiming in the ocean with my mom, uncle, and aunt, and it occured to me that i could start a blog. And, if you knew me, you would know i would not forget about that. So here i am, telling total strangers my story.
