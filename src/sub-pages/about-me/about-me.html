      Hi. My names Lily.
      I have blonde hair, blue eyes,
      and VERY chewed fingernails.
      My favorite color is indigo, purple,
      and navy blue. Anyway, so, like, I started a blog because one day I was swiming in the ocean with my mom, uncle, and aunt, and it occured to me that i could start a blog. And, if you knew me, you would know i would not forget about that. So here i am, telling total strangers my story.
      It all started last year in third grade when two of my friends were drawing dresses on paper. I tried it, and i hated it. I was terrible at it. So then, one of my friends saw me sa and gave me a blank dress and said: "Color" So thats wat i did. And , I swear, It was one of the best feelings i my life. 
      It seems weird, but trust me, it felt amazing. And I was amazing AT it! Okay, okay, I got better over time but i was pretty good. Now, i have my friends draw me great clothes on paper, then i make them even GREATER with color. I just love it. And so now you know another thing about me. I LOVE coloring! (AND fashion!)
      But since then, i've grown a lot with my skill, and started sewing and much more. 
      Anyway, I've always had a little trouble making friends. Why? Cause i'm bossy. And I can be really bossy. Like, a lot bossier then BOSS BABY. Which, by the way is one of my fave movies. 
      Anyway, so thats where the idea came from. I had been thinking about it for a while. You may be wondering where the idea is in all that. Well, I also talk a lot. Like, a lot a lot. It can be annoying for both me but also mostly others. Well, I thought that  if I started a blog, then nobody would judge me. Why? Cause they can't hear me actally talking. 
      Anyway, I also want to thank my Uncle, who was a absolutly amazing blog-making teacher. 
      I ALSO want to thank all the people who supplied pictures for my blog on the internet.
      Thanks!!!!
